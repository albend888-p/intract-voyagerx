# Linera x Intract: VoyagerX Campaign

I suggest playing the game Guess the Word. 
The program choose of a random word and tells you the number of letters. After each attempt to solve a word, the program will tell you the letters that you guessed and also the letters that are not in the word. Good luck killing a lot of time!
